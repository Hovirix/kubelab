description: Independently review the current HX Lab feature

Load the `hxlab-feature` skill.

Review focus supplied by the user:

$ARGUMENTS

Execute only the independent verification phase of the skill.

Requirements:

1. Read the repository instructions and reconstruct the intended outcome from:
   - the parent feature request;
   - the implementation report;
   - the current branch and complete working-tree diff.

2. Inspect relevant surrounding files and compare the implementation with the repository's existing patterns.
3. Use the built-in `explore` agent when broader repository inspection would improve the review.
4. Perform focused upstream research only when correctness depends on external, current, deprecated, or version-specific behavior that was not already verified.
5. Review:
   - functional correctness;
   - repository and domain consistency;
   - scope control;
   - GitOps integrity;
   - secret safety;
   - exposure, identity, RBAC, permissions, and trust boundaries;
   - dependency ordering;
   - version compatibility;
   - failure and rollback behavior;
   - validation coverage;
   - unrelated or generated-file changes;
   - completion conditions still requiring live verification.
6. Run the smallest relevant deterministic validation commands already provided by the repository.
7. Always inspect:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
git diff
```

8. Do not modify files, implement fixes, commit, push, merge, reconcile, or mutate live cluster state.
9. Do not accept implementation-agent claims without verifying them from repository evidence or command output.
10. Do not report live completion before reconciliation and functional verification.

Do not run:

```text
git commit
git push
task cluster:reconcile
flux reconcile
kubectl apply
kubectl create
kubectl edit
kubectl delete
helm upgrade
```

Report findings first, ordered by severity:

```text
BLOCKER
HIGH
MEDIUM
LOW
```

Each finding must include:

- the affected path or command;
- the concrete problem;
- why it matters;
- the required correction or decision.

Then report:

### Validation

List every command executed and its result.

### Upstream verification

State whether upstream research was used and summarize any version-specific conclusions.

### Security review

State whether the change is security-sensitive and whether dedicated Security Agent review is still required.

### Completion conditions

Mark each condition as:

- verified locally;
- pending live verification;
- unsatisfied;
- blocked.

### Residual risks

List remaining uncertainty, operational risks, and rollback concerns.

### Live checks required

List the exact checks that `/reconcile` must perform.

Finish with exactly one verdict:

```text
READY FOR RECONCILIATION
CHANGES REQUIRED
BLOCKED BY MISSING INFORMATION
```
