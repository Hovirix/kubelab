description: Implement and locally validate an HX Lab feature
agent: build
---

Load the `hxlab-feature` skill.

Feature request:

$ARGUMENTS

Execute the skill workflow from understanding the request through the
implementation report. Stop before independent verification, Git publication,
or live reconciliation.

Requirements:

1. Read the existing repository instructions and inspect the working tree.
2. Use the built-in `explore` agent for focused repository discovery when useful.
3. Perform focused upstream research whenever implementation depends on
   external, current, deprecated, or version-specific behavior.
4. Follow the repository's existing agent-routing and domain-ownership rules.
5. Establish observable completion conditions and a concise implementation plan.
6. Implement the smallest coherent Git-managed change.
7. Request Security Agent review when the change affects secrets, identity,
   permissions, RBAC, exposure, certificates, destructive behavior, or trust
   boundaries.
8. Run the repository's relevant deterministic validation entrypoints.
9. Inspect the complete final diff and preserve unrelated user changes.
10. Do not commit, push, merge, reconcile, or mutate live cluster state.

Do not run:

```text
git commit
git push
task cluster:reconcile
flux reconcile
kubectl apply
kubectl create
kubectl edit
kubectl delete
helm upgrade
```

End with the implementation report defined by the skill and exactly one verdict:

```text
READY FOR /verify
NOT READY FOR /verify
BLOCKED BY USER DECISION
```
